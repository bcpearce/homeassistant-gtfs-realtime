[ ] This is an update to an existing feed
[ ] This feed requires signup for authentication (API key, etc.)

Feed data can be tested by adding a `user_feeds.json` file to the `gtfs_realtime` folder on your install. Or by configuring as a custom feed. Feeds added in this file are loaded alongside the public feeds on GitHub.  You can test a feed out beforehand by adding this file and including it there. See `feeds.json` for the format schema. 

[ ] I have tested the feed using a custom configuration or `user_feeds.json` and confirmed that it works.
